	// Keyboard-navigation cursor state. This project's own addition -
	// see GridItem.hpp's class comment for why: Stand's own keyboard
	// navigation moves a cursor through its Command tree (a per-
	// CommandList m_cursor plus a root_cursor for its tab strip), a
	// whole system this project doesn't have. This is the flattened
	// equivalent that fits what this project does have instead - one
	// sidebar (MenuGrid's own GridItemTabsVertical) and one active
	// content Grid (MenuNavigation::Current()) at a time:
	//
	// - Sidebar: GridItemTabsVertical owns its own active index
	//   directly (GetActiveIndex()/MoveActive()) - MenuFocus only
	//   tracks whether the sidebar or the content Grid currently has
	//   focus, not which sidebar entry.
	// - Content: MenuFocus itself tracks an index into whatever the
	//   current content Grid's own getFocusableItems() returns,
	//   resetting to 0 whenever that Grid changes underneath it (a
	//   sidebar switch, or a GridItemFolder Push()/Backspace Pop()) -
	//   detected lazily, by comparing against the Grid pointer last
	//   seen, rather than needing every call site that can change
	//   MenuNavigation's current Grid to remember to reset this too.
