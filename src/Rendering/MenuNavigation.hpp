	// previous one. This replaces the horizontal-tab-strip navigation
	// the very first cut of this system used, which doesn't match how
	// Stand's menu behaves at all (Stand has no tab strip - "Main"'s
	// items and the other categories are all just rows/nested rows in

	// GridItemFolder - built inside content Grids like SelfGrid/
	// VehicleGrid, which have no reference to MenuGrid itself - needs to
	// push onto this directly from onClick(). MenuGrid only reads it
	// (Current()/BreadcrumbPath()) and resets it when the sidebar
	// selection changes (Reset()).
