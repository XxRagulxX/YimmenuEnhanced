	// gesture (this menu has no mouse - see HotkeysGrid.hpp's own class
	// comment for the "Clear" button that replaces it).
	//
	// The original captures by holding the mouse down on the row's own
	// button (ImGui::IsItemActive()), polling live key state every
	// frame it's held (DrawHotkey.cpp's own g_HotkeySystem.CreateHotkey()
	// call) and stopping the instant the mouse is released - there's no
	// mouse here, so Enter (activate()) instead *toggles* capture on/off,
	// and draw() (which, like the original's own render callback, runs
	// every frame this row is visible) polls while armed instead of a
	// held-mouse check. Two safety nets a toggle (rather than a held
	// gesture) needs that "release the mouse" made automatic in the
	// original:
	// - Losing keyboard focus while still armed auto-stops capture (same
	//   "no separate blur event, so check it in draw()" reasoning as
	//   GridItemTextInput's own auto-commit).
	// - A bounded timeout (kCaptureTimeout) auto-stops it regardless -
	//   covers closing the whole menu (Insert) while still armed, which
	//   stops draw() from running at all until the menu reopens, so
	//   nothing would otherwise ever clear HotkeySystem's own
	//   m_BeingModified flag (which a still-armed row leaves set,
	//   silently suppressing every hotkey menu-wide) until it does.
