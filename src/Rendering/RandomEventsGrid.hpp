	// Content grid for Network > Random Events: mirrors MenuRandomEvents.cpp's
	// BuildRandomEventsMenu() in full - a single "Triggerer/inspector" page
	// for one of 24 fixed freemode random events at a time (Select Event),
	// showing its live server-side state and offering Launch/Kill/Teleport
	// actions plus a per-event cooldown/availability override, exactly the
	// one Group the original has (there's no sub-navigation here at all).
	//
	// Select Event uses GridItemSelectList the same way TransactionsGrid's
	// own Category/Action pickers do - 24 fixed named options, same shape
	// as those 28/60-entry arrays, just sourced from World/RandomEvents.hpp
	// (a real shared header with external linkage, unlike Transactions.cpp/
	// VehicleEditor.cpp's own file-static tables - included directly here
	// rather than duplicated, same as this project already does for e.g.
	// Network/CNetShopTransaction.hpp). Every other file-static helper the
	// original's own .cpp has (GetEventStateString/GetNumLocallyActiveEvents/
	// ResetEventTunables/OnComboChange/KillActiveEvent, and the hardcoded
	// ScriptFunction/ScriptPointer signatures inside them) is still mirrored
	// verbatim as this class's own private methods, same "mirror the
	// original's logic, don't reuse it" approach as every other port in
	// this series.
	//
	// Every native/global-state read the original's own ImGuiItem lambda
	// makes every frame (GPBD_FM_2::Get()/GSBD_RandomEvents::Get()/
	// RANDOM_EVENTS_FREEMODE_DATA::Get(), each event's own live State) is
	// re-read fresh inside its own watchCondition() predicate or fresh
	// local lookup at the top of populate() rather than cached on this
	// class - see populate()'s own comment for why (the same staleness
	// hazard SyncThread()/SyncVehicle() exist to avoid elsewhere, just
	// solved here by never caching the pointers across a populate() call
	// instead of needing a dedicated Sync method, since nothing here reads
	// them from draw()/drawText()/findItemAt() directly).
	//
	// selectedEvent/selectedSubvariation/setCooldown/setAvailability/
	// applyInMinutes were file-static locals in the original (persisting
	// across menu open/closes, shared by every ImGuiItem frame) - this
	// class's own instance members serve the exact same role, since this
	// Grid instance is itself the same kind of long-lived singleton (see
	// NetworkGrid.cpp's note on why content Grids are owned as file-scope
	// statics).
