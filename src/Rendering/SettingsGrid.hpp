	// Settings' five categories (Hotkeys, GUI, Game, Customize, Lua
	// Scripts), same as every other root's "Categories" section.
	//
	// Every one of Settings' five categories now points at a real
	// content Grid (HotkeysGrid/SettingsGuiGrid/SettingsGameGrid/
	// CustomizeGrid/LuaScriptsGrid, owned here since nothing else
	// reaches them) - see each one's own class comment for what it
	// covers. Hotkeys' and Customize's are both replacements rather
	// than straight ports: Hotkeys for how it replaces the original's
	// single hand-rolled ImGui widget and its mouse-hold capture
	// gesture; Customize for how it replaces the original's ImGuiStyle/
	// ImGuiCol_* editor (meaningless once this Grid renderer is
	// primary) with Theme.hpp's own six colours instead.
