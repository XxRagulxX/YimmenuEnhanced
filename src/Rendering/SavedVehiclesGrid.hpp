	// only shows its "New Folder" name field while browsing Root (saving
	// into an existing folder doesn't need one) - this always shows it,
	// and Save only actually uses it when the current folder is Root,
	// rather than repopulating the page every time the folder changes
	// just to show/hide one row.
