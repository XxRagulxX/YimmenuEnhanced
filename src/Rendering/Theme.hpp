	// Stand's own default (unthemed) look - genuinely verified this time
	// against origin/stand-reference (a branch of this same repo, not
	// something fetchable from the open internet - a previous pass here
	// wrongly assumed it didn't exist and edited several comments to hedge
	// that; that hedge was itself wrong). See that branch's own src/
	// Rendering/Renderer.hpp, the Renderer class's own default member
	// values: focusRectColour = {1,0,1,1}, bgRectColour = {0,0,0,0.3019},
	// bgTextColour = {1,1,1,1}, addressbar_height = 24, tabs_width = 112,
	// tabs_height = 32, command_width = 450, command_height = 32 - every
	// one matches what this file already had.

	// The one accent colour: whatever's currently active, on, selected,
	// or otherwise the thing that matters right now - a sidebar/tab's
	// active entry, a toggle's ON state, a button's fill. Stand's own
	// focusRectColour.
	//
	// This and the five colours below are `inline` (mutable), not
	// `constexpr`, specifically so Settings > Customize (CustomizeGrid)
	// can edit them at runtime - see its own class comment for why this
	// project's actual theme editor lives there instead of the classic
	// menu's own ImGui-style Customize page (which edited ImGuiStyle/
	// ImGuiCol_*, meaningless once this Grid renderer is primary). Every
	// existing `Theme::kAccent`-style reference elsewhere in this
	// codebase keeps working unchanged either way - dropping `constexpr`
	// doesn't change how the name is used at any call site, only that it
	// can now change after startup. LoadFromDisk()/SaveToDisk() persist
	// these six; nothing else in this file is user-editable (layout/
	// scale constants stay `constexpr`).

	// The translucent panel background every non-active row uses -
	// toggle/folder rows, inactive sidebar/tab entries, a stepper/list's
	// value box. Stand's own bgRectColour, confirmed 0.3019 alpha exactly
	// (see this file's own top comment).
	//
	// A previous pass here invented a second, more-opaque "backdrop"
	// constant on top of this one, on the theory that real Stand must be
	// compositing some separate solid panel underneath its rows - it
	// isn't. Checked against origin/stand-reference's own src/Menu/
	// GridItemList.cpp: real Stand draws bgRectColour exactly once, as a
	// single rect spanning the whole (unfocused) list - not per row - and
	// its rows have zero gap between them (no separate spacer; they're
	// just offsets inside one GridItemList, not individually positioned
	// GridItems). The reason this project's own rows read as "very
	// transparent" was never that 0.3019 was too low - it's that every
	// row here IS its own separate top-level GridItem, positioned through
	// Grid::setPositions() using this content Grid's own spacer_size,
	// which every content Grid's own constructor set to 3 - the same gap
	// real Stand only ever uses between distinct chrome pieces
	// (addressbar/tabs/list), never between individual rows within one.
	// That left a real, unrendered 3-unit seam of bare game world between
	// every single row. Fixed at the source instead: every content Grid's
	// own spacer_size is 0 now (see each one's own constructor comment),
	// so rows pack edge to edge the same way Stand's own list does, and
	// bgRectColour's existing 30% alpha reads as one continuous panel
	// rather than a stack of separately-transparent strips.

	// that no real source existed to check them against; reverted back
