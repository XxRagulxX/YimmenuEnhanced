	// A Grid whose own content includes a horizontal tab strip, with
	// whichever tab's own target Grid is currently active drawn right
	// alongside it - the Grid-level equivalent of TabBarItem/TabItem
	// (src/TabBarItem.cpp/TabItem.cpp) for the ImGui menu.
	//
	// A distinct mechanism from GridItemFolder/MenuNavigation (which
	// replace this system's *entire* content column when a nested
	// category is entered): a tab strip switches only its own page's
	// content, in place, alongside whatever else that page has - what
	// Vehicle > Spawn's New/Personal split and Recovery > Heists' six
	// heist types need, and what a plain content Grid or a
	// GridItemFolder target can't express on its own.
	//
	// Each tab's target Grid needs its own origin baked in at
	// construction time, positioned to sit right where the tab strip's
	// own content area should start (this class does not reposition a
	// target Grid's items - every other content Grid in this system
	// already hardcodes its own origin the same way, so a tabbed page's
	// targets do too, just offset further down/right to clear the tab
	// strip itself). A subclass builds its own populate() as normal (for
	// whatever comes before/after the tab strip) and calls InitTabs()
	// from it to install the strip and remember each tab's target.
	//
	// One known gap: mouse-wheel scrolling (GridRenderer::WndProcImpl's
	// content->ScrollBy() call) always scrolls *this* Grid's own item
	// list (just the tab strip, in practice), never whichever target is
	// currently active - Grid::ScrollBy()/ScrollToShow() aren't virtual,
	// so a target Grid with more content than fits on screen has no way
	// to be reached by the wheel today. Not fixed here; revisit if a
	// tabbed page's own content actually needs to scroll.
