namespace YimMenu::Rendering
{
	// Ported from stand-reference's src/Menu/GridItem.hpp - same fields,
	// same names, same alignment-relative positioning contract (Grid::
	// setPositions() assigns x/y; onPositioned() is the hook a subclass
	// overrides to react). Two differences from Stand's real class:
	//
	// - draw() is split into draw()/drawText(), not one draw(). Stand's
	//   own D3D11 renderer defers every draw call into a sorted list and
	//   flushes it in one pass at frame end, so a single draw() is free
	//   to intermix rect and text calls in any order. This project's
	//   DirectXTK12 renderer instead opens one PrimitiveBatch (rects)
	//   and one SpriteBatch (text) per frame as two separate scopes -
	//   see GridRenderer::DrawImpl - so every item's rect work has to
	//   happen in one pass and its text work in another. Not a stylistic
	//   choice; the two batch types are different pipeline states that
	//   can't be freely interleaved within one Begin/End scope.
	// - onClick() exists here; Stand's own GridItem has no such hook,
	//   since Stand routes interactivity through its Command tree
	//   instead (a GridItemList's rows each resolve back to a Command,
	//   which is what actually reacts to a click) - a whole system this
	//   project hasn't ported. Until it has, GridItem owning its own
	//   click handling is this project's own addition, kept because
	//   every widget built on this base still needs some way to react
	//   to being clicked.
	// - isFocusable()/activate()/onArrow()/isKeyboardFocused() are this
	//   project's own addition too, for the same reason: Stand's own
	//   keyboard navigation moves a cursor through its Command tree
	//   (CommandList::m_cursor), which doesn't exist here. MenuFocus.hpp
	//   is this project's flattened equivalent - one focused item at a
	//   time within whatever content Grid MenuNavigation::Current()
	//   currently is - and these hooks are how a widget opts into it
	//   (isFocusable()), reacts to Enter (activate()) and to Left/Right
	//   (onArrow(), for a value a widget can cycle/step directly instead
	//   of just leaving focus - see e.g. GridItemCommandList::onArrow()).
