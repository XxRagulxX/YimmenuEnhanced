	// Ported from stand-reference's src/Menu/Grid.hpp - same origin/
	// spacer_size/items fields (items is a soup::SharedPtr-wrapped
	// vector, same as Stand's own - this project already depends on
	// soup elsewhere (src/PatternBatch.hpp, src/Pointers.cpp, ...), so
	// porting Stand code that uses a soup:: type keeps using it rather
	// than substituting something else), same setPositions()/
	// getOccupant()/getItemByType() contract. Differences from Stand's
	// real class:
	//
	// - populate() is called once, lazily, on first use
	//   (ensurePopulated() below) rather than Stand's own repeatable
	//   update()/updateNow() (which reruns populate() on a background
	//   Worker thread whenever a Grid's contents need to change live -
	//   e.g. a saved-locations list changing while the menu is open).
	//   This project has no Worker-driven live-repopulation model yet -
	//   invalidate()/watchCondition() below cover the common case
	//   (a row's own existence depending on a BoolCommand/predicate) by
	//   just re-running populate() synchronously the next time draw()/
	//   drawText()/findItemAt() notices one changed, same as
	//   PlayersGrid's own hand-written repopulation-on-change already
	//   did before this generalized it. Something like an actual saved-
	//   locations list changing size while showing is still nothing this
	//   covers - that's the point to add update()/updateNow() for real,
	//   using the FiberPool job queue this project already has instead
	//   of Stand's own Worker.
	// - draw() only does rects; drawText() is this project's own
	//   addition, and findItemAt() too - see GridItem.hpp's class
	//   comment for why (DirectXTK12's two-pass rendering, and this
	//   project not having Stand's Command tree to route clicks through
	//   instead).
	// - No border_width/border_colour/predraw_flags/content_update_queued
	//   - all exist in Stand to support borders and the background
	//   Worker-driven repopulation above, neither of which this project
	//   has yet.

		// GridItem.hpp's class comment - every row here is already its
		// own top-level GridItem rather than sub-rows of one list widget.
		// Scrolling the whole Grid's own item list vertically is the
		// equivalent for that shape: draw()/drawText()/findItemAt() all
		// apply the current scroll offset (by temporarily shifting each
		// item's own y, calling through, then restoring it - so no
		// widget needs to know scrolling exists at all) and skip drawing/
		// hit-testing anything that scrolls above origin.y, so a scrolled
		// item can never render on top of whatever sits above this Grid
		// (MenuGrid's own header bar, for a content Grid). Nothing skips
		// the bottom edge the same way - a row scrolled past the visible
		// area's bottom just runs off the real screen's edge, which the
		// GPU clips on its own.
		//
