	// autodrivespeed/autodrivestyle are gated on IsAutoDriveEnabled()
	// (VehicleGrid.cpp) - autodrive OR npcautodrive being on, the same
	// combined-BoolCommand-predicate technique as SelfGrid.cpp's
	// ShouldClearOrSetWanted().
	//
	// Also the Vehicle submenu's root as far as MenuGrid/MenuNavigation
	// are concerned: Populate() appends a GridItemFolder row for each of
	// Vehicle's other categories (Spawn, Vehicle Editor, Saved Vehicles)
	// after the items above - see SelfGrid.hpp's identical note. Each
	// folder points at a real content Grid (VehicleSpawnGrid/
	// VehicleEditorGrid/SavedVehiclesGrid, owned here since nothing else
	// reaches them) - see each one's own class comment for what it
	// covers.
