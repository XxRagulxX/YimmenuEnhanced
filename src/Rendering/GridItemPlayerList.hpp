	// see onArrow()'s own doc comment for why not Up/Down) selects that
	// player (Players::SetSelected()); the selected row highlights the

	// everything else in this system works (see GridItem.hpp's class
	// comment) - populate() only ever runs once (see Grid.hpp's own
	// class comment on why), but players join and leave throughout a
	// session, so a fixed set of per-player GridItems built at populate
	// time would go stale immediately. This re-reads Players::GetPlayers()
	// itself on every draw()/drawText()/onClick()/onArrow() call instead.
	// Self-sizing to a fixed maximum number of visible rows (kMaxRows) -
	// with more players connected than that, only the first kMaxRows
	// (alphabetically) show; there's no scrolling within a single
	// GridItem the way Grid itself can scroll between items.
