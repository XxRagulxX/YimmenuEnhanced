	// TextWrapped, which every pre-port ImGui overlay in this system
	// relied on), so this replaces it wherever one of them needs to show
	// a block of text that might not fit on one line (Notifications'
	// own message body, ChatDisplay's own messages, ...). Same
	// "simplest thing that still works" trade-off as everywhere else in
	// this system without a real text-layout engine: no hyphenation,
	// and a single word wider than maxWidth on its own just overflows
	// rather than being split mid-word. scale is whatever the caller
	// will actually draw the wrapped lines at - MeasureText needs it to
	// measure accurately.
