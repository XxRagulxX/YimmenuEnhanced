	// Ported from real Stand's own CommandSliderRainbow: not a colour
	// itself - a speed control (0 = off, otherwise milliseconds per
	// step) that drives ANOTHER slider's own value up by 1 every that
	// many ms, wrapping back to its minimum at its maximum. Real Stand
	// uses this to auto-cycle a hue/index slider for its own Weapon
	// Tint Rainbow and Hair Rainbow features - this project doesn't
	// have either of those yet, but the widget itself has no dependency
	// on what it's driving.
	//
	// Needs its own continuous per-tick timing (the same "keeps
	// re-applying every tick, not just on change" gap TogglePointer/
	// SliderPointer's sibling files already disclose elsewhere), solved
	// the same safe way as CommandWalkSpeed.cpp/CommandSwimSpeed.cpp's
	// own hidden always-on LoopedCommand - except owned directly by this
	// class (a private nested Ticker member) rather than hand-written at
	// each use site, since unlike Walk Speed/Swim Speed this widget is
	// meant to be reusable.
