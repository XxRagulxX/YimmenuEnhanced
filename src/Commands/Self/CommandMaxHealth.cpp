	// Every other IntCommand in this codebase is a plain value holder
	// with a separate LoopedCommand actually applying it each tick (see
	// CommandWanted.cpp's own wantedslider/freezewanted split) - there's
	// no real Stand-style "continuously re-applied slider" idiom here.
	// This applies the value once, immediately, whenever it changes
	// (IntCommand::OnChange() already runs on the game script thread via
	// FiberPool - see IntCommand::SetState()) rather than re-asserting it
	// every tick - a real, disclosed gap from Stand's own persistence
	// (something else resetting max health later, e.g. on respawn,
	// wouldn't get immediately overridden the way Stand's own tick
	// handler would), but keeps this a single row rather than a second
	// "lock" toggle nothing else in Stand's own UI has either.
