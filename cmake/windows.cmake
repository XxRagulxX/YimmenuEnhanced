# This file is included right after project() (before any add_library()
# calls) so that the runtime-library selection below applies to every
# target in the build. It is split into two parts:
#
#   1. stand_apply_common_compile_options() - flags that apply to the Stand
#      target on EVERY build of this project, native or cross-compiled,
#      because both use an MSVC-compatible compiler driver. Always
#      available, and also called by CMakeLists.txt for the Linux -> Windows
#      cross build (see cmake/cross-compile.cmake).
#
#   2. Everything else - native-Windows-only setup (x64 enforcement,
#      compiler identification, MSVC runtime library, /MP), which returns
#      immediately when cross-compiling so it never conflicts with
#      cross-compile.cmake's toolchain.

# Bake the active MSVC/Windows SDK include paths into explicit flags

# cl.exe/clang-cl.exe normally find the CRT/STL/Windows SDK headers through
# the INCLUDE environment variable, which is only set once you've run
# vcvarsall.bat (or opened a "Developer Command Prompt", or - in VS Code -
# let the CMake Tools extension apply the environment of the kit you
# selected). That's fine for the actual CMake-driven build, since CMake
# Tools (or vcvarsall) sets INCLUDE for the whole configure+build
# subprocess.
#
# compile_commands.json, though, only records each translation unit's
# argv - never the environment it was compiled with - and clangd (a
# separate, long-running process VS Code starts on its own, without going
# through CMake Tools or vcvarsall) has no way to recover that INCLUDE
# value later. Without it, clangd can't find <windows.h> or any other
# system header, no matter how correct the recorded argv otherwise is.
#
# So: while INCLUDE is actually set (i.e. right now, during configure),
# turn each of its directories into an explicit flag on every compile
# command - the same self-contained-compile_commands.json approach
# cmake/cross-compile.cmake already uses for the Linux -> Windows build.
# Harmless for the real build (compilers ignore a search path they'd have
# found anyway); it's what makes clangd work without depending on how
# VS Code itself was launched.
